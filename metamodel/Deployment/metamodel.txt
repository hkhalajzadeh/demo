Relationship Types
==========================
Association [UML]
	An association describes a semantic connection between two classes. Each association relationship is characterized derivation rules and documentation. The roles of the association are further characterized to define associations in more detaile with the following properties:
	- association name according to the direction of the associaton 
	- role name to characterize the class/objects role in the relationship
	- multiplicity constraint 
	- ordered? to define whether links between objects have order
	- navigable? to indicate that navigation is supported along the association relationship towards the class/object attached to the arrow, and 
	- qualifiers to define values which serve to partition the set of objects associated with an object across an association.
	Binary associations are most common, but n-ary connection can be specified with an ternary association. Also association class, OR association, and note connection can be attached to aggregations by selecting the relationship and then adding a new role to the relationship through a selection from a pop-up menu.

Dependency [UML]
	Dependency show client-supplier links dependencies between logical elements. The client, pointed by an arrow, is dependent in some way on the client.

Artifact
	Artifact Name: String
Node
	A node denotes to a resource in the real world, such as printer, CPU, and memory, which can distribute and execute elements of our logical models. A node is represented as a three-dimensional rectangular. Node can be either a type or an instance and it can be characterized with a stereotype and documentation text.
